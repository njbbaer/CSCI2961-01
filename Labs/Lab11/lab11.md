* **Describe the difference between synchronous and asynchronous communication.**
* Synchronous communication allows for a message to be received and responded to immediately. A chat room is an an example of synchronous communication. Asynchronous communication means that there is a delay between when messages are sent and responded to. Email is an example of asynchronous communication.
* **Compare the HCI issues in individual interaction with group interaction.**
* Human–computer interaction between individuals and machines requires methods of common communication that can be understood by both, such as computer programs or well designed software. Human–computer interaction with groups is about computer software that helps facilitate communication between people in a group.
* **Discuss several issues of social concern raised by collaborative software.**
* Collaborative software is great because it allows many people to contribute to a project, but without a single leader group participants may disagree on the direction to take the project. Disagreements between group members can lead to the collapse of the project.
* **Discuss the HCI issues in software that embodies human intention.**
* In order to interact properly with a human, a computer must understand the humans intended action. This can be difficult because computers usually do not understand human speech or facial expressions that might hint at the user's intent.

* **This article talks about the need for a coding standard**
* Everyone who learns to code begins to create a style for themselves. The styles affect things such as tabs or spaces, where to place curly braces, quotes or double quotes, and white space. Although everyone has their own preferences, it is necessary that groups working together conform to a common style. Common coding standards provided options for groups that they should communicate and decide upon. A good coding standard makes the code more readable, easier to understand and prevents mistakes.
* **In this video, Crockford uses JavaScript to illustrate key ideas about programming style**
* Computer programs are the most complicated things people make. Programming languages have allowed humans to create more and more complicated software. JavaScript is a language that is easy to make mistakes and programmers should follow a strict coding style. Some programs can check your code for proper programming style. A good coding style is resistant to errors. Programs should be easily readable and look like what they do.
* **Read about the Google Style Guide**
* The Google Style Guide is a set of common coding standards for the Java programming language. This assists Google engineers on deciding upon a common standard for their Java code. It describes which conventions programmers are to use or not use. The Google standard is also used by many other companties and open source projects.
