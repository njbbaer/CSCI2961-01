* Changed the british spelling of "colour" to the american "color" in the FreeBSD porter's handbook. FreeBSD prefers the american spelling.

* Good documentation should be the most important source of information for a project. New users will use it to become familiar with the project and its standards. Established users may need it to refresh their memory or gain familiarity with recent additions. Without good documentation a project will quickly become disorganized as competing ideas destroy the unity of the project.

## Open source
* Fast bug fixes and feature implementation
* Usually free to use
* Many sources of support (can be good or bad)
* Less security vulnerabilities

* A side project should probably be open source because it allows the community to help with your project. You have little to gain financially by closing the source unless you are hiding a ground breaking invention, which is unlikely. 

## Proprietary
* Single source for support and upgrades
* Provider is liable for support
* More reliable
* Often costs money
* Slower bug fixes and updates

* If you're a company most of your software should probably be closed source. Otherwise your competitors could steal your ideas and implement them yourself. A company might want to make its software open source if it's trying to encourage a community around its software ecosystem (such as Google's Android) or to build goodwill amongst developers.
